- Difference between a Library and Framework?
  - Source: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-difference-between-a-framework-and-a-library-bd133054023f/ 
    Both libraries and frameworks are reusable code written by someone else. Their purpose is to help you solve common problems in easier ways. **Library** is simple a piece of resuable code file that can be imported in several places of the appplication and make it easier to code using DRY(dont repeat yourself) concept. With **Framework** it is more of a bundeled architecture/collection of library files and set of rules that combinly allows user to build an application using the couled framework architecture and methodsex: **Angular** is a framework where **React** is a Library.
    A framework inverts the control of the program. It tells the developer what they need. A library doesnâ€™t. The programmer calls the library where and when they need it.
- What is CDN? Why do we use it?
  - A content delivery network (CDN) refers to a geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.Source: https://www.cloudflare.com/en-in/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/
  **benefits of using a CDN**
  -Improving website load times - By distributing content closer to website visitors by using a nearby CDN server (among other optimizations), visitors experience faster page loading times. 
  - Through caching and other optimizations, CDNs are able to reduce the amount of data an origin server must provide, thus reducing hosting costs for website owners.
  - Thanks to their distributed nature, a CDN can handle more traffic and withstand hardware failure better than many origin servers.
  - A CDN may improve security by providing DDoS mitigation, improvements to security certificates, and other optimizations.
